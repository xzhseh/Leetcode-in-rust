# Leetcode in Rust (& a little bit Java)

This repository is my solutions for the leetcode problems written in ***Rust*** by me.

You can find all the solutions in the `src` directory, 
and you actually can run it by yourself in the `main()` function of the `main.rs` file.

*Notice: For those without a possible API for **Rust**, I use **Java** instead.*

*Also, please use `ctrl + F` to find the solutions provided in the `src` directory :)*
